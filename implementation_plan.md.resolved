# Hanuman Chalisa Official — Website/WebApp

A modern, premium website dedicated to Lord Hanuman, designed to attract **young professionals and students** by blending ancient spiritual wisdom with a contemporary digital experience. Integrates with the YouTube channel "Hanuman Chalisa Official" and its 108-day Hanuman Chalisa series.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **YouTube Channel Link Needed:** Please share your exact YouTube channel URL and/or the 108-day playlist URL so I can embed the correct videos. I'll use placeholder links for now.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Domain / Hosting:** This will be a static site (Vite + React) that can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host. Let me know if you have a preferred domain or hosting platform.

> [!NOTE]
> **No Backend Required:** All tools (streak tracker, chanting counter, bookmarks) use browser `localStorage`, so no database or server is needed. The site is fully self-contained.

## Design Philosophy

| Aspect | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Theme** | Dark mode primary with **saffron/orange (#FF6B00, #FF9933)** accent — Hanuman's sacred color |
| **Typography** | Google Fonts: **Outfit** (headings) + **Inter** (body) — clean, modern, premium |
| **Visual Style** | Glassmorphism cards, subtle particle effects, smooth scroll animations |
| **Layout** | Mobile-first, single-page app with section-based navigation |
| **Imagery** | AI-generated Hanuman artwork in a modern illustrative style |
| **Tone** | Empowering, not preachy — "spirituality as a superpower for modern life" |
